                    <p>  We are very happy to announce attendance support opportunities for students to attend DBML 2022, 
                        which allow free workshop registration for virtual attendees. 
                        Due to the limited funding opportunities, there is a strong focus on universities in developing countries (as listed by ACM). 
                     </p>
                       <p>   Who can apply:
                     The first author of the accepted papers at DBML 2022 can apply, who are also full-time students (graduate or undergraduate) affiliated with universities. 
                     </p>
